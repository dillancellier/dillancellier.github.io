        <div class="publication-details"> Neural timescales can be thought of as the 'memory' of brain activity. The slower the timescales, the longer that the neural activity is staying self-similar. Faster timescales, on the other hand, may indicate that information is entering and disappearing from a neural circuit rapidly. Here, we tested whether electroencephalography (EEG) signals reflect slower or faster neural timescales when humans are performing a task. We found that in more complicated tasks, neural timescales (as measured from EEG) slow down more. Additionally, oscillatory activity shifts from being dominated by faster alpha-band (8-12 Hz) rhythms to slower theta-band (4-8 Hz) signals. </div>

                Dynamics of Hierarchical Task Representations

        <div class="publication-details"> 
        Task representations are often hierarchical in nature-- that is, rules are set according to a specific context, and when that context changes, the rules change along with it. This type of rule structure can be mapped out in a decision tree, where a series of if-then statements help you determine the ultimate response. In this study, we examined the neural oscillations that are most present during moments when someone is switching from one rule context (one branch of the decision tree) to another. We found evidence supporting the hypothesis that task rules are indeed represented hierarchically, where high-level information about the context is encoded in a broad range of low-frequency EEG activity (delta to beta-band), and interacts with lower-level information such as that of the task-relevant feature and response rule.
